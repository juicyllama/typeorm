# TypeOrm

This npm package is a NextJS/TypeORM opinionated utility package designed to help abstract out helper functions and have a specific format for handing CRUD based operations with TypeORM.

This works best with an abstracted baseService class allowing you to spin up NestJS modules with almost zero code.
